  |   Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where       |
  |   kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as      |
  |   the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course;    |
  |   and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to       |
  |   please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat           |
  |   unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you   |
  |   as a security guard than to find a repairman.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   From your small office you must watch the security cameras            |
  |   carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that         |
  |   you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know).    |
  |   That means when you run out of power for the night- no more           |
  |   security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely   |
  |   if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you       |
  |   must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?                              |
  |                                                                         |
